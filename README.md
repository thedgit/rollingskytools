Note: The project is still being developed.

Editing via text is confusing, so I created some tilesets that you can use.
The tilesets are created in GIMP with the picture size of 600x600.
You can download the files above, then create a `New Tileset` in Tiled.


*I didn't save the .xcf file for the tilesets 1-200, so :( for that.*
